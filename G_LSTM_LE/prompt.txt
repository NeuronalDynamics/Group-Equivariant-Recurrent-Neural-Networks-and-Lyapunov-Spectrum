I love this plan. Please, let's write the abstraction part of the paper. Please make sure this is a journal-level paragraph and every single sentence is backed by existing literature and factors/evidence.  Then, please output this in LaTeX format. Including reference at the end of the overleaf document


Please double check each of your reference and make sure they are all correct

start from the begining and right after outline. Write solid proof. Do numerical simulation after training. From the begining, incoperate Continous symmetry

What results we have so far?
1. Calibration plots for LSTM, G-LSTM and Kronecker G-LSTM
2. Lyapunov spectrum plots for LSTM, G-LSTM and Kronecker G-LSTM
3. Lyapunov spectrum plots for continuous RNN, static CAN, moving CAN

What result we do not have yet?
1. Training performance comparison between LSTM, G-LSTM and Kronecker G-LSTM (Engelken Gradient Flossing or Lazy vs Hasty figure 1)
2. Eigenvalue spectrum (Back it with clear Lyapunov and (optionally) Jacobian spectral‑radius plots)
3. End with a short empirical teaser that “the same models also train faster / need fewer examples”, flagging this as future work.



How to connect this to biological system/neuroscience data? Let’s try may connect to GLIFR in the discussion for the discrete symmetry
